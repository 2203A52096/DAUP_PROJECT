# DAUP_CSV : DATA SET PROTEIN
--> Data set taken from kaggle from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gallo33henrique/bioinformatics-protein-dataset-simulated 
In the project the foolowing things are done:
--> Data reading
--> data exploration
--> data visualization using scatter plot, histogram, box plot
--> selecting target and featues
--> pre preocessing
--> svm, models are tained
--> classification report and confusion report are printed
--> Classes with few data points are fixed and outliers are removed
--> SMOTE is applied
--> the new data is prepreocessed and same models are trained
--> Classification report and confusion matrix are preinted
After removing outliers and applying SOMTE and then trained models showm increase in accuracy, f1 scre, precision, recall and support
