# DAUP_CSV : DATA SET PROTEIN
--> Data set taken from kaggle from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gallo33henrique/bioinformatics-protein-dataset-simulated 
In the project the foolowing things are done:
Data reading is performed to load the dataset.

Data exploration is conducted to understand the structure and contents of the data.

Data visualization is done using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to identify patterns and distributions.

Target and features are selected for model training.

Data preprocessing is applied to clean and prepare the data.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) and other models are trained on the preprocessed data.

Classification report and confusion matrix are printed to evaluate the initial model performance.

Classes with very few data points are addressed, and outliers are removed to improve data quality.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to handle class imbalance.

The new data is preprocessed again, and the same models are retrained.

Updated classification report and confusion matrix are printed after retraining.
After removing outliers and applying SOMTE and then trained models showm increase in accuracy, f1 scre, precision, recall and support
